        "comment": "An experiment I have done before with similar parameters, changing a single word across multiple image generations, keeping the same seed and generation settings. This time the results were a bit different. While there are many similarities across the different images, the setting sun on the left contrasted by a blue sky to the right and the brownish buildings, the characters themselves were quite different. The last time I tried it, mostly only the face of the characters would change, not the overall pose and accessories. This might be due to the changes to how newer versions of Stable Diffusion generate images.",
